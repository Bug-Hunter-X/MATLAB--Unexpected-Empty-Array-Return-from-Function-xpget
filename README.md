# MATLAB Unexpected Empty Array Return

This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB bug related to unexpected empty array returns from a function. The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The `myFunction` function sometimes returns an empty array (`[]`), which can lead to issues when this function is called by another part of the program.  Debugging this problem can be tricky as it doesn't throw a traditional error message.  Instead, it may lead to unexpected results or silent failures.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for the empty array condition and handling it appropriately. The solution code provides a more robust way to manage the return value of the function.

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open MATLAB.
3.  Run `bug.m` and observe the output.
4.  Run `bugSolution.m` and compare the output to see the corrected behavior.
